# careerWebsite
This is a job vacancies webapp specifically designed for intern job opportunities

## Getting Started
Clone this repositories to your device by running "git clone https://github.com/kevinCostnerr/careerWebsite.git" on terminal.

## Prerequisites
You would need to have Node.js installed in your device. You also need to have MongoDB installed as well.

run the install command on your terminal window with the "npm install" command after you are at the project directory after that,
run "npm start" to start the server.

## Coding Style
- Braces are required for all control structures
- Variables are using camelCase
- Module namespaces may never be named as a direct child of another module's namespace.
- Filenames should be all lowercase
- Require statements, grouped together immediately following the module declaration
- Use four spaces for indenting
- One statement per line
- Have a comment on every function that describes its purpose
- Column limit of 80 characters
- Don't abbreviate local variable
- Ordinary string literals are delimited with single quotes ('), rather than double quotes (").
- An empty block or block-like construct may be closed immediately after it is opened, with no characters, space, or line break in between (i.e. {}), unless it is a part of a multi-block statement
- Every statement must be terminated with a semicolon.
- Prefer to put all function arguments on the same line as the function name. If doing so would exceed the 80-column limit, the arguments must be line-wrapped in a readable way.
- Embed function comments in /* */
